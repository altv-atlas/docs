**Project Icarus** is a framework targetted at making it easier for developers to get started with alt:V Multiplayer. As of right now we only offer server-side packages written in C#.

Project Icarus is designed to ease your initiation into alt:V MP. By providing a range of server-side packages written in C#, this framework and it's modules simplify the creation of your very own alt:V MP server!
